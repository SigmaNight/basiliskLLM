# üêç BasiliskLLM: Where LLMs Unite

***In Development - Yep, it's still crawling. Cue the baby theme music.***. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## So, What's the Idea Here?

**BasiliskLLM** is like the cool uncle of LLM interaction tools. Drawing "inspiration" (a.k.a. brilliant ideas stolen in the dead of night) from [OpenAI's NVDA add-on](https://github.com/aaclause/nvda-OpenAI/), it aims to do what every project dreams of: actually be useful. Our noble mission? To make chatting with large language models (LLMs) so easy, even your grandma could do it blindfolded. Whether you're into OpenAI, OpenRouter, Mistral, or running your own secretive AI in the basement, we've got you covered. Yes, even you, screen reader users. We see you.

### And the Name? Seriously?

Why does anyone name anything? Partially as a joke, partially hoping it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why this particular name? It's a nod to the infamous **Roko's basilisk**, which if you're curious (or bored), you can dive into [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk) and [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rokos-basilisk). Spoiler alert: it's the ultimate rabbit hole.

## üõ† Setting Up Your Dev Palace üè∞

Requirements: Python 3.12.2 (because only the best for us, obviously)

The project requires poetry. To install it visit the [Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx).
For short reference:

```shell
pip3.12 install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install poetry
```

In the root of what may soon become your favorite project, install dependencies with poetry. It will create a special virtual environment for the project.

```shell
poetry install
```

Activate the virtual environment (because magic needs a little nudge):

```shell
poetry shell
```

Ready to watch the code baby crawl, maybe even walk? Fire up the project:

```shell
cd src
python main.pyw
```
