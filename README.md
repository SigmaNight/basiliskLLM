# üêç BasiliskLLM: Where LLMs Unite

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/basiliskllm/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/basiliskllm)
[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/SigmaNight/basiliskLLM/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SigmaNight/basiliskLLM/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
In Development - It's still in its infancy. Use with caution!

## So, What's the Idea Here?

**BasiliskLLM** is like the cool uncle of LLM interaction tools. Drawing "inspiration" (a.k.a. brilliant ideas stolen in the dead of night) from [OpenAI's NVDA add-on](https://github.com/aaclause/nvda-OpenAI/), it aims to do what every project dreams of: actually be useful. Our noble mission? To make chatting with large language models (LLMs) so easy, even your grandma could do it blindfolded. Whether you're into Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or running your own secretive AI in the basement, we've got you covered. Yes, even you, screen reader users. We see you.

### And the Name? Seriously?

Why does anyone name anything? Partially as a joke, partially hoping it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why this particular name? It's a nod to the infamous **Roko's basilisk**, which if you're curious (or bored), you can dive into [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk) and [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rokos-basilisk). Spoiler alert: it's the ultimate rabbit hole.

## Key features

- **Multi-Chat Support**: Chat with multiple LLMs at the same time.
- **Describe Image**: Describe the image in the chat. The image source can be a screenshot, a regular file, or a URL.
- **Speech to Text**: Transcribe text from the microphone or an audio file into the prompt.
- **Multi-Conversation**: You can have multiple conversations at the same time.
- **Auto-Update**: The app will check for new versions and update automatically.
- **NVDA Add-on**: You can send the image of the current object directly to the active chat from any application.
- **Secure Your Credentials**: You can secure your credentials using the Windows Credential Manager.

## account configuration

When you run the app for the first time, it will prompt you to configure your account. Alternatively, you can configure your account by clicking on the 'Tool' menu and selecting 'Manage Account.'

A configuration window will appear, allowing you to enter your API key and select the AI provider you wish to use. You can also configure the Credential Manager to securely store your API key.

You can obtain an API key from your chosen AI provider. The app supports the following AI providers:

- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api)
- [Gemini](htps://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/)
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)

## Shortcuts

Except for global shortcuts, keyboard shortcuts are displayed alongside the labels of their corresponding elements.

### Global shortcuts

These shortcuts work anywhere in Windows.

- **`AltGr+Shift+B`**: Minimize to tray or show the BasiliskLLM window.
- **`AltGr+Shift+W`**: Take a screenshot of the current window and send the image to the active chat.
- **`AltGr+Shift+F`**: Take a screenshot of the full screen and send the image to the active chat.

**Note**: You can also minimize the window using `Alt+F4`.

### BasiliskLLM window shortcuts

These shortcuts work only when the BasiliskLLM window is focused.

- **`Ctrl+1` to `Ctrl+9`**: Select the corresponding tab. Each tab is a different chat.
- **`Ctrl+n`**: Create a new chat.
- **`Ctrl+w`**: Close the current chat.

### Contextual Shortcuts

The multiline "System prompt," "Messages," and "Prompt" fields come equipped with context menus filled with commands that can be quickly executed using keyboard shortcuts. The same applies to the models list. These shortcuts are active when the relevant field is in focus.

Examples of Contextual Shortcuts in the Messages Area:

- **`j`**: Move to the previous message.
- **`k`**: Move to the next message.

**Note**: Context menu can be opened using the `Shift+F10` key combination, the `Applications` key, or by right-clicking on the field.

## NVDA Add-on Connector

For those using NVDA, you can install the NVDA add-on connector to send the image of the current object directly to the active chat from any application.

To install the NVDA add-on connector, navigate to the Tools menu > Install NVDA add-on.
Once the add-on is installed, you can use the following shortcuts:

- **`NVDA+SHIFT+k`**: Capture the current navigator object and send it to BasiliskLLM.
- **`NVDA+SHIFT+l`**: Send the current image source to BasiliskLLM (url or base64).

## Automatic update of the Application (Windows only)

The app includes a built-in auto-update feature with three update channels:

- `stable`: the stable version of the app (default a stable release on GitHub)
- `beta`: the beta version of the app (default a pre-release on GitHub)
- `dev`: the dev version of the app (default the last commit on the master branch)

You have four update modes available:

- **notify**: the app will notify you when a new version is available.
- **download**: the app will download the new version but you have to install it manually.
- **install**: the app will download and install the new version automatically (not implemented yet).
- **off**: the app will not check for new versions.

## üõ† Setting Up Your Dev Palace üè∞

Requirements: Python 3.12 (because we settle for nothing but the best, naturally)

The project requires poetry. To install it visit the [Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx).
For short reference:

```shell
pip3.12 install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install poetry
```

In the root of what may soon become your favorite project, install dependencies with poetry. It will create a special virtual environment for the project.

```shell
poetry install
```

Activate the virtual environment (because magic needs a little nudge):

```shell
poetry shell
```

Ready to watch the code baby crawl, maybe even walk? Fire up the project:

```shell
python -m basilisk
```

### üöÄ Build Standalone Executable

You can build a standalone executable with the following command:

```shell
poetry run python -m cx_Freeze build_exe
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the standalone executable. You can run the executable by double-clicking on it.

### üì¶ Packaging for Windows

The project utilizes Inno Setup to create an all-in-one installer, packaging the output generated by cx_Freeze. ...

To create the installer, you need to install Inno Setup. You can download it from [here](https://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).

After installing Inno Setup, check that the `ISCC.exe` is in your PATH. You can do this by running the following command:

```shell
where ISCC.exe
```

If the command returns the path to the `ISCC.exe`, you are good to go.

You can create the installer by running the following command:

```shell
iscc win_installer.iss
```

This will create an installer in the `output_setup` directory.

## üåç Translations

This project welcomes translations.
If you'd like to help translate the project into your language, you have two methods to choose from:

### using Crowdin (recommended)

You can contribute translations using the Crowdin platform. You must have a Crowdin account to contribute.
Then visit the [BasiliskLLM Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/basiliskllm) to get started.
If your language is not listed, please open an issue to request it.
To translate, you can use the Crowdin web interface or the Crowdin CLI.

### using the `.pot` file

You can retrieve the `.pot` (Portable Object Template) file from the releases page and translate it using a text editor like [Poedit](https://poedit.net/).

Alternatively, generate a `.pot` file from the source code with the following command:

```shell
python setup.py extract_messages
```

To create a PO (Portable Object) file for your language, use the command:

```shell
python setup.py init_catalog --locale <your_language_code>
```

The language code should adhere to the ISO 639-1 standard. For instance, the code for Spanish is `es`. You can find the appropriate code for your language [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

Use a text editor like [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) to translate the strings in the `.po` file. Once you've finished translating, compile the `.po` file into an `.mo` (Machine Object) file with the command:

```shell
python setup.py compile_catalog
```

Finally, create a pull request with your translated `.po` file.
